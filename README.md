I am a Master's student in ECE at The University of Texas at Austin, graduating in December 2024. 

My research interest is primarily in the intersection of Machine Learning & Software Engineering. I'm most skilled in building data pipelines, designing models, model deployment, and model validation. In the past, I've worked on the perception of self-driving cars, and deploying ML onto tiny resource-constrained devices.
